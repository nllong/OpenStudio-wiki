Since you have read-only access to the OpenStudio repository, you should [create a Fork](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/fork) in order to make changes.  Select your personal account if you are given the option:

Next, download and install [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/), or a Git shell if you are on a different platform.  Enter your GitHub account username and password, then select your username in the left column of the GitHub app and clone your fork:

Once you have committed and pushed all of your changes, and your branch is ready to be approved for inclusion in the main OpenStudio repository, click the green Compare button in your fork on github.com and follow [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) for submitting a pull request.
