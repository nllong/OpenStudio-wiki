Since you have read-only access to the OpenStudio repository, you should [create a Fork](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/fork) in order to make changes.  Select your personal account if you are given the option.

Next, download and install [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/), or a Git shell if you are on a different platform.  Enter your GitHub account username and password, then select your username in the left column of the GitHub app and clone your fork.
